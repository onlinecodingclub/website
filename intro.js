The teachers and admins could be given the responsibility of managing it and also the project can be extended to be developed as a full-scale product. This would probably urge all the students as well as the staffs to set their skill range as high as possible. It will help the students to take a better step in their careers. Student can eliminate the fear to code as they would start cultivating the habit of coding right from the beginning. Integrating the features in one single platform brings in a uniformity in which students learn rather than using multiple IDEs to code and learn.");
